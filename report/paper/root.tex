\section{INTRODUCTION}


\section{RELATED WORK}


\section{PROBLEM DEFINITION}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Talk about teach and repeat
    \item How teach maps are aquired (point clouds are taken at regular steps)
    \item Why we want to optimize this (loop closure spped, memory for large maps)
\end{itemize}


\section{OUR APPROACH}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Choose elipse of a given shape. We assume that if ICP converges on the
    ellipse, it would converge at any given point inside the ellipse (we need the explain why we made this assumption)

  \item For each point, find the nearest point that doesn't converge with ICP

  \item Create an oriented graph where arcs represents a successful ICP convergence

  \item Find the shortest path in the graph from that converge

\end{itemize}

\section{EXPERIMENTS}
We can talk about the offline optimisation we did on some dataset.

\section{FUTURE WORK}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Experiment with Husky

  \item Multi objective optimization to have an automatic error elipse

  \item handling rotations (3D ellipsoid)

  \item Reoptimisation of the graph

\end{itemize}
